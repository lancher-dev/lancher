A minimal, local project-template manager written in Go.

`lancher` lets you organize and use project templates stored on your machine. You can register directories as templates, list them, and generate new projects from them. Templates can come from local paths or from git repositories (via HTTPS or SSH). Each template may include a `.lancher.yaml` file for metadata and post-creation hooks, allowing you to customize how new projects are initialized.

## Installation

Download and install the latest release with a single command:

```bash
curl -sS https://lancher.dev/install.sh | sh
```

The installer automatically detects your platform and downloads the appropriate pre-built binary.
